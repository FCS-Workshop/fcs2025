# 2025 Workshop Proposal: Foundations of Computer Security

## Background, Aim, and Scope

Computer security is an established field of both theoretical and practical
significance. In recent years, there has been sustained interest in the formal
foundations of methods used in computer security. The aim of the Foundations of
Computer Security (FCS) workshop is to provide a forum for the discussion of
continued research in this area. FCS welcomes papers on all topics related to
the formal underpinnings of security and privacy, and their applications. The
scope of FCS includes, but is not limited to:

* formal specification, analysis, and design of cryptographic protocols and their applications
* formal definitions of various aspects of security such as access control mechanisms, mobile code security and network security
* modeling of information flow and its application to confidentiality policies, system composition, and covert channel analysis
* foundations of privacy
* applications of formal techniques to practical security and privacy

We are interested in new theoretical results, in exploratory presentations that
examine open questions and raise fundamental concerns about existing theories,
and in the development of security/privacy tools using formal techniques.
Demonstrations of tools based on formal techniques are welcome, as long as the
demonstrations can be carried out on a standard digital projector (i.e., without
any specialized equipment).  We solicit the submission of both mature work and
work in progress.

Inspired by the success of mentoring workshops at bigger conferences and
building on the our own success last year, FCS will provide its attendees with
mentoring opportunities alongside the research track.  As with last year, the
goal of the program this year is to address the mentoring needs of aspiring and
junior researchers. It is difficult but necessary for them to build long-term
connections in the programming languages community, and to access the
perspectives of researchers from other institutions. Thus, the FCS workshop
plans to have a couple mentoring sessions throughout the day to meet such
mentoring needs.
